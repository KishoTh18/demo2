# My First GitHub Repository

Welcome to my first GitHub repository! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

This repository marks the beginning of my journey with GitHub. It's a simple project where I tested out the basics of version control, including creating a repository, committing changes, and pushing code to GitHub. 

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- **index.html:** A basic HTML file I used to test my first commit.
- **styles.css:** A simple stylesheet to add some basic styling to the HTML page.
- **README.md:** The file you're reading right now, which provides an overview of the project.

## What I Learned

- How to create a GitHub repository.
- How to make my first commit and push it to GitHub.
- How to create and write a `README.md` file.

## Future Plans

As I continue learning, I plan to:

- Add more projects to this repository.
- Explore branches and merging.
- Collaborate with others on GitHub.
